        <h2>Built With</h2>
        <p>
        express - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
        mongoose - Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
        body-parser - Node.js body parsing middleware.
        <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Downloading For External Use</h2>
        <p>
        The 4 production dependencies are listed above however there are also 4 recommended development dependencies that will help with the testing included and further development.
        <br>
        chai - Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser.
        mocha - Simple, flexible, fun JavaScript test framework for Node.js & The Browser.
        nodemon - nodemon will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application.
        supertest - HTTP assertions made easy via superagent.
        <br>
        
        Not included in this repository are the development/test/production files in the config folder that export (through an index file) a string that is a link to the mongo database e.g. "mongodb://<user>:<password>@<mlab:port>/<database-name>".
                <br>
        The seed file provided should create an appropriate local mongo database. This can be ran using 'node seed/run-seed.js
        <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Testing Code Additions</h2>
        <p>
        The provided tests (ran through the 'npm test' script) are set up to test all of the existing server endpoints and correct/incorrect usage of them by users. Any tests written for additional endpoints created should follow the same structure.
    </p>
    <br>

       <h2>Hosting</h2>
        The app is hosted on heroku and can easily be re-hosted if this repo is cloned and modified. The 2 config variables that will need to be added are the 'NODE_ENV' (production) and the 'DB_URL' (the link to the hosted mongo database e.g. "mongodb://<user>:<password>@<mlab:port>/<database-name>")
                <br>
        Mongo databases can be hosted on mlab.
